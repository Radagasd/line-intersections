# line-intersections
An HLSL include file for finding the intersection between a line and the following shapes: plane, cylinder, ellipsoid, hyperboloid, paraboloid, ellipse, capped cylinder, capped ellipsoid, capped half hyperboloid, rectangle and a box. Also includes a visualiser shader for URP.

This package is made for my tutorial on line intersections that can be found [here](https://kelvinvanhoorn.com/2021/05/11/math-line-intersections/).
